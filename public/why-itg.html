    <li>We begin by meeting with the team and understanding the current business process and the current painpoints everyone is dealing with.</li>
    <li>Moving to reviewing the current setup of the system.</li>
    <li>Then begin designing solutions and presenting to all team members.</li>
    <li>Finally, make the updates on live system and always available for support.</li>
</ul>
